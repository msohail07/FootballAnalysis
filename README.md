Summary: For NFL defenses, predicting the opponents’ offensive plays can mean the difference between a win and a loss. In this project, I use NFL play-by-play data from 2009-2016 to predict if the offensive team executes a run or a pass. 

Modeling: I focus on two game-time settings. First, the coach’s booth, where coaches have time to interpret a more complex yet highest possible accuracy model. My most successful model here was a Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 61%.  Second, the players on the field when a quick, interpretable model is needed in rushed situations. Here I used a shallow decision tree classifier, which achieved 57% accuracy.

Results: Although the Random Forest and Decision Tree models accuracy was not extremely high, both were able to achieve predictions better than random and thus provide some utility. These scores show a fundamental limit to the model’s performance given the discrete, play-summary dataset where each row only contains information regarding what the final outcome was of a given play. More fine-grained data including players positioning and movement is needed to improve the predictive performance of these models. A computer-vision, neural-network approach seems promising as a future model to explore.
